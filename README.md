### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data professional with a business degree and a passion for finding insights from data. I have experience in machine learning, data analysis, modeling, and visualization using Python, SQL, and other tools. I also have skills in data management and reporting using Metabase, Salesforce, and other platforms.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and explore new challenges in the data world. Iâ€™m currently learning to leverage the use of analytical tools and statistical analysis to solve business problems from lower to higher levels.
Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in data science and analytics projects that can make a positive impact on society.
