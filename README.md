### Hi there 👋
I’m a data professional with a business degree and a passion for finding insights from data.

👩‍💻 I have experience in:
- Machine learning, data analysis, modeling, and visualization using Python, SQL, and other tools
- Data management and reporting using Metabase, Salesforce, and other platforms
- CRM, lead generation data, and analytics for a US startup

📚 I’m always eager to learn new things and explore new challenges in the data world. I’m currently learning to leverage the use of analytical tools and statistical analysis to solve business problems from lower to higher levels.

🚀 I’m looking for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in data science and analytics projects that can make a positive impact on society.
